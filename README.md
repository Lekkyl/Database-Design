# Database-Design
Designing relational database for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for executives to make data driven decisions.

## Scenario
A New York coffee shop chain is looking to expand nationally by opening a number of franchise locations. As part of their expansion process, they want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure.

As a newly hired Data Engineer my job is to design their relational database for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for executives to make data driven decisions.

Their data resides in several different systems; accounting software, suppliers' databases, point of sales (POS) systems and even spreadsheets.

## Software used in this project includes
* PostgreSQL Database
* IBM Db2 Database
* MySQL

## Data used in this project
In this project, I downloaded the modified subset of data from the **Coffee shop sample data**.

In my scenario, I worked with data from the following sources:
•	Staff information held in a spreadsheet at HQ
•	Sales outlet information held in a spreadsheet at HQ
•	Sales data output as a CSV file from the POS system in the sales outlets
•	Customer data output as a CSV file from a bespoke customer relationship management system
•	Product information maintained in a spreadsheet exported from your supplier's database

## Objectives
•	Identify entities.
•	Identity attributes.
•	Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using the pgAdmin ERD Tool.
•	Normalize tables.
•	Define keys and relationships.
•	Create database objects by generating and running the SQL script from the ERD Tool.
•	Create a view and export the data.
•	Create a materialized view and export the data.
•	Import data into a Db2 database.
•	Import data into a MySQL database.
